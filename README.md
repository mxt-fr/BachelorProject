# BachelorProject

In this repository, you can find the report for my Bachelor Project as well as the dxf, stl, step and Arduino code files used to build this iteration of the Robotic Arm. This project was made in the continuity of LÃ©o Wolff's, meaning the repository of his project is complementary to this one. You can find this repository [here](https://github.com/WollfieGitHub/BachelorProject).

## Contents

### 1. Report
This report goes through the whole process of the project, starting by presenting the original project, the issues that arose when testing it and that had to be addressed, the solutions that have been brought, and finally the results and some future improvement paths if other students continue to improve the project.

### 2. Dxf files
These files are used as input to the laser cutter for the MDF parts used in the base and new turntable used for the robotic arm.

### 3. Stl files
These files are used as input for a 3D printer. The files include models for the motor case, the turntable, and smaller parts that have been used for the cable and electronic components management. Other files contain models of these electronic components that have been used to design the base in the right dimensions to fit them. 

### 4. Step file
This step file can be opened using Autodesk Fusion 360 or any other CAD and contains the entirety of the 3D generated designs of this project.

### 5. Arduino code
Contains an example of an Arduino code that can be uploaded on the Arduino Mega 2560 board to control the arm and test its functioning. 

### 6. Wiring circuit diagrams
Contains two diagrams, one for the A4988 drivers and the five smaller motors, and one for the TB6600 drivers and the two bigger motors.

### 7. Pictures
Contains different pictures that have been included in the report.
