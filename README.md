# BachelorProject

In this repository, you can find the report for my Bachelor Project as well as the dxf, stl, f3d and Arduino code files used to build this iteration of the Robotic Arm. This project was made in the continuity of LÃ©o Wolff's, meaning the repository of his project is complementary to this one. You can find this repository [here](https://github.com/WollfieGitHub/BachelorProject)
